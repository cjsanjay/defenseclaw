# DefenseClaw Local Observability Stack

End-to-end OTLP downstream so you can point a locally-running
DefenseClaw sidecar at a real collector, real metrics store, real log
store, real trace store, and a pre-provisioned Grafana — all on
loopback, all driven by `docker compose`.

## Quick start

The recommended path boots the stack, waits for readiness, and writes
the `otel:` block in `~/.defenseclaw/config.yaml` automatically:

```bash
defenseclaw setup local-observability up
defenseclaw gateway                            # reads config.yaml
defenseclaw setup local-observability status   # compose ps + readiness probes
```

Raw compose access (identical container outcome, no CLI side-effects on
`config.yaml` — use in CI or when another preset owns the `otel:` block):

```bash
cd bundles/local_observability_stack
./bin/openclaw-observability-bridge up         # or ./run.sh up (compat shim)
eval "$(./bin/openclaw-observability-bridge env)"
go run ./cmd/defenseclaw gateway
```

Grafana is provisioned with four datasources (Prometheus, Loki, Tempo,
and a `Prometheus-Alerts` Alertmanager-shim that surfaces the rules in
`prometheus/rules/alerts.yml`) and a tagged dashboard pack under
**Dashboards → Browse → `defenseclaw`**:

| Dashboard | Audience | What to watch for |
|---|---|---|
| **Overview** | on-call landing | alerts, SLO gauges, guardrail outcomes, findings, and canonical errors |
| **Agent Activity (Live)** | developers / IR | cross-agent prompts, model usage, tools, destinations, and session correlation |
| **Agent identity** | governance / IR | logical agents, runtime instances, discovery confidence, and Agent360 links |
| **Agent360** | developers / SOC | one agent tree's lifecycle, tools, tokens, decisions, recovery, topology, and traces |
| **AI Agent Usage & Detection** | security / governance | active AI signals, detector health, confidence, vendor/product inventory, and scan traces |
| **Hook Connectors** | platform | connector traffic, latency, evaluation outcomes, silence, and drift |
| **Connector Detail** | connector developers | one connector's hook phases, model activity, findings, and recent events |
| **Guardrail Evaluations** | security / IR | allow/alert/confirm/block funnel, severity, latency, and judge reliability |
| **Policy decisions** | governance | evaluated tools, observe-mode would-blocks, URL destinations, and policy events |
| **HITL** | security / governance | hook confirmations plus chat/execution approval outcomes when those modes are active |
| **Findings** | detection engineers | per-rule incidence, first/last seen, target attribution, and verdict correlation |
| **Scanners (Ops)** | scanner developers / SRE | rolling scan counts and duration, findings, quarantine, and scanner errors |
| **Proxy & LLM Guard** | proxy operators | HTTP/tool/admission/LLM telemetry when proxy/router mode is active |
| **Runtime & Reliability** | SRE | process, SQLite, hook SLOs, exporter health, audit delivery, schema violations, and panics |

All dashboards cross-link via the "Dashboards" dropdown on the Overview,
and the `ALERTS{alertstate="firing"}` annotation overlay is enabled on
the Overview so you can see when a page fired against the data you're
looking at.

### Metric naming convention

The OTel SDK emits metrics like `defenseclaw.scan.duration` (unit `ms`).
Prometheus exposes them as `defenseclaw_scan_duration_milliseconds_*`
(dots → underscores, unit expanded to its long form, `_total` appended
to counters). Recording rules in `prometheus/rules/recording.yml`
pre-aggregate the most-used queries so dashboards remain snappy.

## Alerts

Alert rules live in
[`prometheus/rules/alerts.yml`](prometheus/rules/alerts.yml) and are
mounted read-only into the Prometheus container; recording rules live
next to them in `recording.yml`. Alerts fall into five groups — each
rule has a `summary`, a `description` that tells you which dashboard to
open, and where relevant a `runbook` pointer under
`docs/OBSERVABILITY-CONTRACT.md#runbook-*`.

| Group                       | Example alerts | Severity |
|-----------------------------|----------------|----------|
| `defenseclaw.correctness`   | `DefenseClawSchemaViolations`, `DefenseClawGatewayErrorsSpike`, `DefenseClawPanic` | critical / warning |
| `defenseclaw.slo.alerts`    | `DefenseClawBlockSLOBreach`, `DefenseClawTUIRefreshSLOBreach` | critical / warning |
| `defenseclaw.pipeline`      | `DefenseClawOTLPExporterStalled`, `DefenseClawAuditSinkFailures`, `DefenseClawAuditSinkCircuitOpen` | critical / warning |
| `defenseclaw.security`      | `DefenseClawBlockRateSpike`, `DefenseClawJudgeErrorRate`, `DefenseClawWebhookFailuresSustained` | warning |
| `defenseclaw.traffic`       | `DefenseClawHTTP5xxSpike`, `DefenseClawHTTPAuthFailuresSurge`, `DefenseClawRateLimitSurge` | warning |
| `defenseclaw.runtime`       | `DefenseClawGoroutineLeak`, `DefenseClawSQLiteBusyRetries`, `DefenseClawConfigLoadErrors` | warning |
| `defenseclaw.connectors`    | `DefenseClawConnectorHookErrorRate`, `DefenseClawConnectorAgentIdChurn` | warning |
| `defenseclaw.ai_discovery`  | `DefenseClawAIDiscoveryStalled`, `DefenseClawAIDiscoveryDetectorErrors` | warning |
| `defenseclaw.observability_pipeline` | `DefenseClawLokiIngestOverflow` | warning |

Rules are owned by Prometheus (so they keep firing even if Grafana is
down). Grafana reads them through the `Prometheus-Alerts` Alertmanager
datasource, which makes them visible under **Alerting → Alert rules**
and through the **Firing alerts** table on the Overview dashboard.

To iterate locally:

```bash
# Edit rules
$EDITOR prometheus/rules/alerts.yml
# Reload Prometheus in place (config.reload is enabled)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/-/reload
# Check the parser / current evaluation state
curl -s http://localhost:9090/api/v1/rules | jq '.data.groups[].name'
```

To pipe alerts to Slack / PagerDuty / Opsgenie, drop a standard
`alertmanager` service into `docker-compose.yml`, point Prometheus at
it via `alerting.alertmanagers` in `prometheus.yml`, and reuse the
existing labels (`severity`, `surface`, `slo`) for routing.

## Runtime schema validation

In parallel with this stack, `gatewaylog.Writer` runs a **strict JSON
Schema validator** against every event it emits. Violations are dropped
from the sinks, surface as an `EventError(subsystem=gatewaylog,
code=SCHEMA_VIOLATION)`, and increment
`defenseclaw_schema_violations_total`. The panel "Schema violations /
min" on the dashboard is the canary for contract drift.

To disable validation locally (e.g. when iterating on a new event
type), set `DEFENSECLAW_SCHEMA_VALIDATION=off` before starting the
sidecar.

## Services

| Service          | Host port(s)       | Notes                                                       |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `otel-collector` | 4317, 4318, 8888 | OTLP gRPC (4317), OTLP HTTP (4318), self-telemetry (8888) |
| `prometheus`     | 9090             | Scrapes collector self-metrics and receives application metrics by remote write |
| `loki`           | 3100               | Receives logs via OTLP HTTP                                 |
| `tempo`          | 3200, 9095         | HTTP query (3200), gRPC (9095). Traces enter via the collector on 4317 |
| `grafana`        | 3000               | admin / admin; anon Viewer role enabled (loopback only)     |

## DefenseClaw upgrades

`defenseclaw upgrade` refreshes an installed copy of this bundle as part of
the ordinary one-command upgrade. It validates the complete target manifest,
backs up every DefenseClaw-managed file under the upgrade backup's
`local-observability-stack/managed/` directory, and then activates the target
files as an all-or-rollback transaction.

Files that exist only in the installed stack are operator-owned and remain in
place. If an operator changes a path also shipped by DefenseClaw, the target
version replaces that managed path, records the conflict in
`refresh-backup.json`, and retains the exact previous bytes in the backup.
The four Compose named volumes (`prometheus-data`, `loki-data`, `tempo-data`,
and `grafana-data`) are never reset by upgrade. A stack that was running is
stopped with `down` (without `-v`), refreshed, restarted, and checked for
service readiness plus all fourteen dashboard UIDs.

A refresh/rollback safety failure leaves target services stopped and reports
the recovery backup. A later stack restart/readiness failure is reported as
degraded without undoing an otherwise healthy gateway upgrade; recover with
`defenseclaw setup local-observability up`.

## Teardown

```bash
defenseclaw setup local-observability down     # stop containers, keep data
defenseclaw setup local-observability reset    # stop + drop all volumes
```

Equivalent raw invocations (same container outcome):

```bash
./bin/openclaw-observability-bridge down       # or ./run.sh down
./bin/openclaw-observability-bridge reset      # or ./run.sh reset
```

## Notes

- All services are bound to loopback only — safe on multi-tenant dev
  boxes but won't be reachable from another host. Override `HOST_BIND`
  in your environment (e.g. `HOST_BIND=0.0.0.0 ./run.sh up`) if you
  need remote access. Before doing so, change Grafana's default
  `admin / admin` password and disable the anonymous Viewer role —
  loopback is the only thing keeping those credentials safe.
- The collector's `debug` exporter is on for every pipeline. Tail
  `./run.sh logs otel-collector` to watch raw OTLP frames while
  iterating on the sidecar contract.
- `./run.sh reset` is explicitly destructive to local observability
  history: it leaves the rest of your system alone but wipes every
  metric, log, and trace in the four named volumes. Ordinary upgrades
  and `down` never invoke this reset path.
